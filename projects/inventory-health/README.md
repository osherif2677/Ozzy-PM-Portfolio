Inventory Health Optimization & INF Reduction

Operational Case Study | Project Management Work Sample

1. Project Overview

This project documents an operational initiative focused on improving inventory health execution to reduce Item Not Found (INF) rates during online order fulfillment.

High INF rates were negatively impacting customer experience, fulfillment efficiency, and inventory accuracy. The objective was not to build a production analytics system, but to design and test a lightweight operating mechanism that improves daily execution discipline and drives measurable performance improvement.

Primary goal:

Achieve and sustain sub-5% EOD INF through consistent inventory health execution.

2. Problem Statement

Prior to this initiative, inventory health processes were inconsistently executed across departments, leading to:

Elevated INF rates (7–9%)

Incomplete gap scans and go-finds

Rolled-over freight creating virtual inventory gaps

Limited visibility into execution quality at the department level

Without standardized daily tracking, teams lacked clarity on why INF fluctuated and which operational behaviors were driving outcomes.

3. Success Metrics

The project defined clear, outcome-driven and execution-driven metrics:

Outcome Metrics

EOD INF % (primary success metric)

% of departments under 5% INF

SDU % (Same-Day Unavailable)

Execution / Health Metrics

Gap Scan completion (Y/N)

Go-Find completion and remaining counts

Rolled-over freight units

Gaps with stock scanned

Inventory Health Score (composite directional indicator)

These metrics were intentionally chosen to link process adherence → inventory accuracy → INF performance.

4. Solution Design

The solution centered on creating a daily operating mechanism with three core components:

1. Standardized Daily Data Entry

A simple daily input process captured execution status by:

Department (Center Store, Paleo)

Sub-department (Ambient, Dairy/Chilled, Frozen, Produce, Meat/Seafood)

This ensured consistent, comparable data across days and teams.

2. Centralized Raw Data Store

Daily entries appended to a raw data table that:

Preserved historical context

Enabled trend analysis over time

Captured operational notes and constraints (e.g., labor shifts, late freight)

3. Dashboard for Visibility & Review

A dashboard surfaced:

INF trends over time

Department-level comparisons

Execution risk drivers (rolled freight, missed tasks)

Inventory Health indicators

The dashboard was used as a review and decision-support tool, not as a final analytics platform.

5. Execution & Iteration

The project ran from early September through early November, allowing performance to be observed across multiple operational cycles.

Key execution phases:

Baseline (early September): Elevated INF, inconsistent task completion

Transition (late September – early October): Improved process adherence, early INF reduction

Stabilization (mid-October – early November): Consistent execution and sustained sub-5% INF

Operational constraints such as labor availability and freight timing were intentionally documented to reflect real-world conditions rather than idealized behavior.

6. Results & Impact

By the end of the period observed:

INF trended downward from ~8% to ~4.8–5.0%

Execution consistency improved across all departments

Rolled-over freight occurrences decreased

Inventory Health indicators stabilized

Department-level differences became visible and actionable

This validated the core hypothesis that consistent inventory health execution drives sustained INF reduction.

7. Key Insights

Execution discipline matters more than tooling sophistication

Breaking performance down by sub-department reveals hidden risk patterns

Standardized daily tracking creates accountability without heavy overhead

Directional health metrics are effective for operational decision-making

8. Limitations & Next Steps

This project was intentionally scoped as a pilot / proof of concept.

Future improvements could include:

Automated data ingestion

Normalized health scoring models

Alerting for execution misses

Scaling the mechanism across multiple locations

Predictive modeling for INF risk

9. Artifacts

This repository includes:

Dashboard screenshots illustrating trends and outcomes

Sample data structures demonstrating daily tracking

Documentation mapping metrics to operational decisions

Raw files are included for reference, but the primary focus is on decision-making, execution design, and impact.

10. Why This Matters (PM Lens)

This project demonstrates:

Problem framing under ambiguity

Clear success metrics

Lightweight system design

Iterative improvement

Data-driven operational decision-making

It reflects how a Product / Program Manager approaches real operational problems with limited time, imperfect data, and cross-functional constraints.
