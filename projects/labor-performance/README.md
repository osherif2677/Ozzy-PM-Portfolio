# Labor Performance Dashboard (Cost Reduction)

## Summary
Built an Excel dashboard to monitor labor performance and reduce labor cost by improving productivity (UPH) and labor efficiency while maintaining operational quality.

## Goal
- Improve UPH and labor efficiency week-over-week
- Reduce labor variance by identifying departments driving inefficiency
- Track trends across weeks/months to support weekly action planning

## Key Metrics Tracked
- Average UPH
- Labor Efficiency %
- Labor Variance by Week
- Units Completed
- Supporting quality metrics (e.g., rollover rate / on-time freight where applicable)

## How It Works
1. Data is entered/updated in the **Data** tab.
2. Slicers filter results by **Department**, **Sub-Department**, **Month**, and **Week**.
3. Dashboard visualizes weekly trends + department-level contribution to variance.

## What I Delivered (PM Framing)
- Created a repeatable reporting system to support weekly leadership discussions
- Enabled fast “where to focus” decisions by week and department
- Reduced manual reporting effort and improved visibility into performance drivers
